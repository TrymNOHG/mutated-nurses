mutable struct Gene

    Here 'x' would signify the xth patient. For example, if seq = [3,1,2]. Then patiend_id=3 is the 1st patient, patiend_id=1 is second and so on..
    Therefore, as dnext[1] means distance between 1st and 2nd patient, it would be distance between patiend_id 3 and patiend_id 1.
    Same logic follows for whereever 'x' is used.
